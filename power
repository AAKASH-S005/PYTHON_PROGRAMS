So far, we have only heard of Python's powers. Now, we will witness them!
Powers or exponents in Python can be calculated using the built-in power function. Call the power function  as shown below:

CODE : 
      a = 2
      b = 3
      m = 5

# Calculate a^b
      result1 = pow(a, b)  # Equivalent to a ** b

# Calculate (a^b) % m
      result2 = pow(a, b, m)

      print(result1)  # Output: 8 (2^3 = 8)
      print(result2)  # Output: 3 ((2^3) % 5 = 8 % 5 = 3)
