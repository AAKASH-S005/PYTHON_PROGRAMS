Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:
If  is odd, print Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
If  is even and greater than , print Not Weird

CODE :
      def check_weirdness(N):
        if N % 2 != 0:
          print("Weird")
        else:
          if N in range(2, 6):
              print("Not Weird")
          elif N in range(6, 21):
              print("Weird")
          elif N > 20:
              print("Not Weird")

# Reading input from stdin (standard input)
      if __name__ == '__main__':
        N = int(input().strip())
        check_weirdness(N)
